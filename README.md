# Passos para executar o projeto

instale o Yarn.

## Instalar via npm
É recomendável instalar o Yarn por meio do gerenciador de pacotes npm , que vem junto com o Node.js quando você o instala em seu sistema.

Depois de instalar o npm, você pode executar o seguinte para instalar e atualizar o Yarn:

- npm install --global yarn

## Mac OS
## Homebrew
Você pode instalar o Yarn através do gerenciador de pacotes Homebrew . Isso também instalará o Node.js, se ainda não estiver instalado.

- brew install yarn

## Após a instalação abra a pasta "challenger" e execute o seguintes comandos no terminal.

### yarn start

Executa o aplicativo no modo de desenvolvimento (no terminal).
Abra [http: // localhost: 3000] (http: // localhost: 3000) para visualizá-lo no navegador.



### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
